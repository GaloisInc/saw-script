# Revision history for saw-remote-api

## next -- TBA

* Add remote API support for SAW's experimental MIR verification support:

  * The `SAW/MIR/load module` command loads a MIR JSON file into SAW.
  * The `SAW/MIR/verify` command performs verification of a MIR function.

  See the [remote API
  documentation](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/blob/master/saw-remote-api/docs/SAW.rst#sawmirload-module-command)
  for more detailed APIs for each of these commands. For more information about
  how SAW's MIR verification support works in general, see the `mir_*` commands
  documented in the [SAW
  manual](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/blob/master/doc/manual/manual.md).

## 1.0.0 -- 2023-06-26

* The v1.0.0 release is made in tandem with the SAW 1.0 release. See the
  SAW 1.0 release notes for relevant SAW changes.
* `SAW/set option`'s `"option"` parameter is now allowed to be `"What4 eval"`,
  which controls whether to enable or disable What4 translation for SAWCore
  expressions during Crucible symbolic execution.
* `SAW/set option`'s `"option"` parameter is now allowed to be
  `"lax loads and stores"`, which controls whether to enable or disable relaxed
  validity checking for memory loads and stores in Crucible.
* Specifications now have additional `pre points to bitfield` and
  `post points to bitfield` fields, each of which is a list of "points-to"
  relationships pertaining to structs that contain bitfields. If not specified,
  these will default to empty lists. Bitfields are only meaningful for LLVM
  verification, so JVM specifications must leave these lists empty. Attempting
  to provide a non-empty list for either of these fields in a JVM specification
  will result in an error.
* Introduced new methods `SAW/eval int` and `SAW/eval bool` that allow the
  evaluation of Cryptol expressions into Python values.

## 0.9.0 -- 2021-11-19

* v0.9 release
