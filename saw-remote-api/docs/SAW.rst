SAW RPC Server
==============

Fundamental Protocol
--------------------

This application is a `JSON-RPC <https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ server. Additionally, it maintains a persistent cache of application states and explicitly indicates the state in which each command is to be carried out.

Transport
~~~~~~~~~

The server supports three transport methods:


``stdio``
  in which the server communicates over ``stdin`` and ``stdout`` using `netstrings. <http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt>`_
  
  

``socket``
  in which the server communicates over a socket using `netstrings. <http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt>`_
  
  

``http``
  in which the server communicates over a socket using HTTP.
  
  

Application State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the JSON-RPC specification, the ``params`` field in a message object must be an array or object. In this protocol, it is always an object. While each message may specify its own arguments, every message has a parameter field named ``state``.

When the first message is sent from the client to the server, the ``state`` parameter should be initialized to the JSON null value ``null``. Replies from the server may contain a new state that should be used in subsequent requests, so that state changes executed by the request are visible.

In particular, per JSON-RPC, non-error replies are always a JSON object that contains a ``result`` field. The result field always contains an ``answer`` field and a ``state`` field, as well as ``stdout`` and ``stderr``.


``answer``
  The value returned as a response to the request (the precise contents depend on which request was sent).
  
  

``state``
  The state, to be sent in subsequent requests. If the server did not modify its state in response to the command, then this state may be the same as the one sent by the client. When a new state is in a server response, the previous state may no longer be available for requests.
  
  

``stdout`` and ``stderr``
  These fields contain the contents of the Unix ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` file descriptors. They are intended as a stopgap measure for clients who are still in the process of obtaining structured information from the libraries on which they depend, so that information is not completely lost to users. However, the server may or may not cache this information and resend it. Applications are encouraged to used structured data and send it deliberately as the answer.
  
  
The precise structure of states is considered an implementation detail that could change at any time. Please treat them as opaque tokens that may be saved and re-used within a given server process, but not created by the client directly.
