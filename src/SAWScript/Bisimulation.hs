Module      : SAWScript.Bisimulation
Description : Implementations of SAW-Script bisimulation prover

Stability   : experimental

This module provides tools to prove bisimilarity of two circuits, or of a
circuit and a specification. At the moment, it does this through the single
'proveBisimulation' function, but we will expand this module with additional
functionality in the future.

At its core, we want to prove that two circuits executing in lockstep satisfy
some relation over the state of each circuit and their outputs. To achieve this,
the 'proveBisimulation' command takes:
* A list of already proved bisimulation theorems
* A state relation @srel : lhsState -> rhsState -> Bit@
* An output relation @orel : (lhsState, output) -> (rhsState, output) -> Bit@
* A term @lhs : (lhsState, input) -> (lhsState, output)@
* A term @rhs : (rhsState, input) -> (rhsState, output)@
and considers @lhs@ and @rhs@ bisimilar when the following two theorems hold:
* OUTPUT RELATION THEOREM:
    forall s1 s2 in.
      srel s1 s2 -> orel (lhs (s1, in)) (rhs (s2, in))
* STATE RELATION THEOREM:
    forall s1 s2 out1 out2.
      orel (s1, out1) (s2, out2) -> srel s1 s2

The OUTPUT RELATION THEOREM ensures that if the state relation holds prior to
executing @lhs@ and @rhs@, then the output relation holds after executing @lhs@
and @rhs@.  That is, the two terms step together.

The STATE RELATION THEOREM ensures that if the output relation holds over some
state and output value, then the state relation also holds over that same state.
This ensures that the output relation captures the state relation.

To enable compositionality, 'proveBisimulation' takes a list of proven
bisimulation theorems as 'BisimTheorem's.  For each 'BisimTheorem', this
implementation searches for invocations of the functions in the 'BisimTheorem'
and replaces them with uninterpreted values that satisfy the 'BisimTheorem''s
output relation.  Put another way, if @g_lhs@ contains some function @f_lhs@ and
@g_rhs@ contains some function @f_rhs@ where @f_lhs@ and @f_rhs@ satisfy some
output relation @f_orel@, then in the proof of some OUTPUT RELATION THEOREM for
@g_lhs@ and @g_rhs@, the prover can replace @f_lhs@ with an uninterpreted value
@v_lhs@ and @f_rhs@ with an uninterpreted value @v_rhs@.  Lastly, the prover
assumes @v_lhs@ and @v_rhs@ satisfy @f_orel@.

In order to make this assumption about @v_lhs@ and @v_rhs@, the state relation
of the outer terms must ensure that the inner terms' state relation holds.  As
such, the prover generates and proves a side condition for each applied
'BisimTheorem'.  Let @g_lhs_s@ and @g_rhs_s@ be the states for @g_lhs@ and
@g_rhs@ respectively.  Additionally, let there be a function
@extract_inner_state x x_s y@ that takes an outer term @x@, an outer state
@x_s@, and an inner term @y@, and returns the inner state of @x_s@ that @x@
passes to @y@.  Lastly, let @g_srel@ be the state relation for the @g@ terms,
and @f_srel@ be the state relation for the @f@ terms.  The prover then checks:
  COMPOSITION SIDE CONDITION:
    forall g_lhs_s g_rhs_s.
      g_srel g_lhs_s g_rhs_s -> f_srel f_lhs_s f_rhs_s
      where
        f_lhs_s = extract_inner_state g_lhs g_lhs_s f_lhs
        f_rhs_s = extract_inner_state g_rhs g_rhs_s f_rhs

The reason for all of this complexity around composition is ultimately to reduce
the burden on the SMT solver by uninterpreting functions so that the SMT solver
may handle more complex proofs.

-- values @v_1@ and @v_2@ respectively and adds the assumption @orel v_1 v_2@.
--
-- When simplification succeeds, this function also returns the side condition
-- that the outer state relation from @g_1@ and @g_2@ implies that the inner
-- state relation on @f_1@ and @f_2@ holds.  See the documentation on
