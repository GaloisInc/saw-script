-- | This datatype represents sequents in the style of Gentzen.  Sequents
--   are used to represent the intermediate states of a proof, and are the
--   primary objects manipulated by the proof tactic system.
--
--   A sequent essentially represents a logical claim which is in the process
--   of being proved.  A sequent has some (possibly 0) number of
--   "hypotheses" and some number (possibly 0) of "conclusions". In mathematical
--   notation, the hypotheses are separated from the conclusions by a turnstile
--   character, and the individual hypotheses and conclusions are separated from
--   each other by a comma. So, a typical sequent may look like:
--
--      H1, H2, H3, |- C1, C2
--
--   The logical meaning of a sequent is that the conjunction of all the hypotheses
--   implies the disjunction of the conclusions. The multi-conclusion form
--   of sequent (as is presented here) is typical of a classical logic.
--
--   In a Gentzen-style proof system (such as the sequent calculus), the method by
--   which proof proceeds is to apply inference rules. Each rule applies to a goal
--   sequent (the thing to be proved) and has 0 or more subgoals that must be proved
--   to apply the rule. Part of a proof is completed when a rule is applied which has 0
--   subgoals. When doing proofs in SAW using the tactic system, there is a stack of
--   currently outstanding proof goals (each in the form of a sequent to be proved).
--   Executing a tactic will modify or apply a proof rule to the top goal on the stack;
--   if that subgoal is finished, then the next subgoal becomes active.
--   If applying a rule causes more than one subgoal to be generated, the remaining
--   ones are pushed onto the stack of goals to be proved. An entire proof is completed
--   when the stack of outstanding goals to prove is empty.
--
--   This particular presentation of sequents is a "focused" sequent calculus.
--   This means that a sequent may optionally have a focus on a particular
--   hypothesis or conclusion. Some manipulations of sequents require a focus
--   point to indicate where some manipulation should be carried out, and others
--   will apply in both focused or unfocused states.
