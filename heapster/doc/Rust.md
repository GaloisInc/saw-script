# Type-checking Rust with Heapster

FIXME: write a simple tutorial
- Defining types
- Symbols and name-mangling
- Assuming standard library functions
- Assuming low-level primitives like `memcpy`; refer to the
  [Rust Translation](RustTrans.md) for more detail about the relationship between
  Rust and Heapster types
- Type-checking
