*saw.txt* functionality for developing sawscript scripts

This plugin adds basic syntax highlighting and a vim-slime override. This
allows using vim-slime to send sawscript snippets from a sawscript file to a
running sawscript interpreter. See the official vim-slime documentation for how
to use vim-slime. The most basic command is <C-c><C-c>, which sends the whole
paragraph the cursor is in. Note that the saw interpreter will correctly parse
single top-level statements, but not multpile top-level statements.

Dependencies: vim-slime
