# CVE Checks

## Background.

For background, approach, and useful boilerplate, refer to
  https://github.com/GaloisInc/hello-cve-scans.git

## Quick Start

Ensure you have the following installed (beyond that of sawscript):
  * git
  * wget

Build:
```
cve-reports/bin/cvecheck-build.sh
```

Run the checks:
```
cve-reports/bin/cvecheck-build.sh
```

## Further details on the CVE checks for our three languages:
### Haskell: bin/cvecheck-hs.sh

We use the MangoIV/cabal-audit package
  https://github.com/MangoIV/cabal-audit.git
which is not to be confused with the `cabal-audit` in hackage.
The latter is hopelessly out of date, while the former

  - is beta quality, but is being maintained
  - calls the cabal libraries and thus (for better or worse), inherits
    the cabal settings and environment.
  - uses the advisories in
    https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories.git
    (this also contains some custom Haskell packages)

Note that the advisory database is checked and downloaded each time
that `cabal-audit` is called.

### Python: `bin/cvecheck-py.sh`

**TODO**


### Rust: `bin/cvecheck-rs.sh`

**TODO**
