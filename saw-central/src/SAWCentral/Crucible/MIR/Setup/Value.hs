License     : BSD3
Maintainer  : Ryan Scott <rscott@galois.com>
Stability   : provisional

The module exists separately from "SAWCentral.Crucible.MIR.MethodSpecIR"
primarily to avoid import cycles. You probably want to import
"SAWCentral.Crucible.MIR.MethodSpecIR" (which re-exports everything from this
module, plus additional functionality) instead.

Note [Symbolic enums]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a symbolic MIR enum value is not quite as straightforward as creating
symbolic versions of other compound types, mostly due to the atypical Crucible
representation that enums use. To recap, if we have an enum like this:

  enum E {
    E1(u16),
    E2(u32, u32),
  }

Then this will be implemented using (roughly) the following Crucible `Type`
under the hood:

  (BVType 64, VariantType [StructType [BVType 16], StructType [BVType 32, BVType 32]])

Where:

* The `BVType 64` is a /discriminant/, whose value indicates which variant is
  in use. For instance, a discriminant value of `0` indicates that the `E1`
  variant is in use, and a discriminant value of `1` indicates that the `E2`
  variant is in use.
* The `VariantType ...` indicates that there are two variants in this enum,
  where each variant is represented as a struct with the corresponding fields
  in that variant.

At simulation time, VariantTypes are represented as a sequence of
VariantBranches, where a VariantBranch is (roughly) a pair of:

* A (possibly symbolic) predicate indicating if that variant is being used, and
* A payload representing the fields of the enum. If the predicate does not
  hold, then the payload will likely be symbolic, since it does not matter what
  the payload value is in that case.

OK, recap over. Let's get back to the original question: how do we make a
symbolic value of this type? A na√Øve first attempt is to generate fresh
symbolic values for everything. That is, a symbolic discriminant, as well as a
symbolic predicate and payload for each VariantBranch. While tempting, this
approach won't work. To see why, consider what happens when one pattern matches
on a symbolic enum value. For example, the `match` expression in this function:

  fn foo(x: E) -> u32 {
      match x {
          E::E1(a) => bar(y),
          E::E2(b, c) => baz(b, c),
      }
  }

Would turn into the (roughly) following MIR:

  fn foo(x : E) -> u32 {
      start_block: {
          discr = Discriminant(x, isize);
          switchint discr :isize [0, 1] -> [e1_block, e2_block, fallthrough_block]
      }
      e1_block: {
          ... call bar() ...
      }
      e2_block: {
          ... call baz() ...
      }
      fallthrough_block: {
          unreachable;
      }
      ...
  }

Here, the `switchint discr` statement will check the value of `discr` (the
discriminant), and if it equals `0`, go to `e1_block`; if it equals `1`, go to
`e2_block`; and if it equals something else, go to `fallthrough_block`. In
normal circumstances, `discr` should only ever be equal to `0` or `1`, which
implies that `fallthrough_block` should never be accessible (as indicated by
its `unreachable` instruction).

Now consider what would happen if the discriminant were an unconstrained,
symbolic value. While a symbolic discriminant could be equal to `0` or `1`, it
could also be equal to any other value! This would spell disaster if Crucible
tried to perform a symbolic branch on, say, `discr == 2`, since that would
cause execution to reach `fallthrough_block` and crash. We want a symbolic
discriminant, but we don't want it to be /that/ symbolic!

For this reason, after we create a symbolic discriminant value, we also add a
Crucible assumption that the discriminant must be equal to one of the possible
enum variants' discriminants. In the example above, this means that we would
assume assume the following:

  (discr == 0) \/ (discr == 1)

This way, symbolic execution will never reach `fallthrough_block`. This
Crucible assumption is created in
SAWCentral.Crucible.MIR.Builtins.constructExpandedSetupValue.goEnum`.

Similarly, we cannot make the VariantBranch predicates completely symbolic, as
whether a predicate holds or not depends on the value of the discriminant. For
this reason, we do not create fresh variables for each predicate, but instead
make each predicate the result of checking the discriminant against particular
values. For instance, the predicate for the `E1` VariantBranch is defined to be
`discr == 0`, and the predicate for the `E2` VariantBranch is defined to be
`discr == 1`. These predicates are defined in
`SAWCentral.Crucible.MIR.ResolveSetupValue.resolveSetupValue`, along with the
fields in the associated payloads.

Lastly, there are the payloads (i.e., the fields of each variant) in each
VariantBranch. These are created as completely symbolic values‚Äîthe trick is to
only access the fields when the corresponding predicate holds. For example,
`SAWCentral.Crucible.MIR.Override.matchArg` (in the `MirSetupEnumSymbolic` case)
must be able to match two possibly symbolic enum values together, but it must
be careful to only match the fields in a variant if that VariantBranch's
predicate holds.

To make this a bit more specific, suppose we have two symbolic enum values
`enumA` and `enumA`, where:

* `enumA` has the discriminant value `discrA`, and
  `enumB` has the discriminant value `discrB`.
* `enumA` has the VariantBranches [(e1_pred_a, [e1_fld1_a]), (e2_pred_a, [e2_fld1_a, e2_fld2_a])], and
  `enumB` has the VariantBranches [(e1_pred_b, [e1_fld1_b]), (e2_pred_b, [e2_fld1_b, e2_fld2_b])].

We only want to match `e1_fld1_a` against `e1_fld1_b` if both enums are using
the `E1` variant, that is, if `e1_pred_a` and `e_pred_b` hold. To this end, the
`matchArg` function checks this by generating (roughly) the following
assertion:

  (discrA == discrB) /\
  (e1_pred_a ==> (e1_fld1_a == e1_fld1_b))

(Note that instead of `e1_pred_a ==> ...`, we could have alternatively used
`e1_pred_b ==> ...`, `(discrA == 0) ==> ...`, or `(discrB == 0) ==> ...`. All
formulations are equivalent.)

Phew! Enums are surprisingly tricky.
