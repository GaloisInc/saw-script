# SAWScript

This repository contains the code for SAWScript, the scripting
language that forms the primary user interface to the Software
Analysis Workbench (SAW). It provides the ability to reason about
formal models describing the denotation of programs written in
languages such as C, Java, and Cryptol.

## Documentation

The [SAWScript tutorial](https://saw.galois.com/tutorial.html) gives an
introduction to using the SAWScript interpreter. A longer
[manual](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/blob/master/doc/manual/manual.md)
describes the breadth of SAWScript's features.

## Precompiled Binaries

Precompiled SAWScript binaries for a variety of platforms are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/releases).

## Getting Z3

SAW can use many theorem provers, but because of its use of Cryptol it
always needs to have Microsoft Research's [Z3 SMT
solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) installed.  You can download Z3
binaries for a variety of platforms from their [releases
page](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases).

We currently recommend Z3 4.8.7. If you plan to use path satisfiability
checking, you'll also need Yices version 2.6.1 or newer.

After installation, make sure that `z3` (or `z3.exe` on Windows)
is on your PATH.

## Manual Installation

To build SAWScript and related utilities from source:

  * Ensure that you have the `cabal` and `ghc` executables in your
    `PATH`. If you don't already have them, we recommend using `ghcup`
    to install them: <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/>

  * Ensure that you have the C libraries and header files for
    `terminfo`, which generally comes as part of `ncurses` on most
    platforms. On Fedora, it is part of the `ncurses-compat-libs` package.
    You will also need the C headers for `zlib`.

  * Ensure that you have the programs `javac` and `z3` on your
    `PATH`. Z3 binaries are available at
    https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases

  * Optionally, put in place dependency version freeze files:

        ln -s cabal.<ghc version>.config cabal.project.freeze

  * Build SAWScript by running

        ./build.sh

    The SAWScript executables will be available in the `bin` directory.

  * Optionally, run ./stage.sh to create a binary tarball.

## Notes on LLVM

SAW can analyze LLVM programs (usually derived from C, but potentially
for other languages). The only tool strictly required for this is a
compiler that can generate LLVM bitcode, such as `clang`. However,
having the full LLVM tool suite available can be useful. We have tested
SAW with LLVM and `clang` versions from 3.5 to 9.0, as well as the
version of `clang` bundled with Apple Xcode. We welcome bug reports on
any failure to parse bitcode from LLVM versions in that range.

Note that successful parsing doesn't necessarily mean that verification
will be possible for all language constructs. There are various
instructions that are not supported during verification. However,
any failure during `llvm_load_module` should be considered a bug.

## Related Packages

Many dependencies are automatically downloaded into `deps/` when you
build using `build.sh`; see
[Manual Installation](#manual-installation) above. Key automatically
downloaded dependencies include:

* `deps/abcBridge/`:        [Haskell bindings for ABC](https://github.com/GaloisInc/abcBridge)
* `deps/crucible/`:         [Crucible symbolic execution engine](https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible)
* `deps/cryptol/`:          [Cryptol](https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol)
* `deps/saw-core/`:         [SAWCore intermediate language](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-core), used by CSS, JSS, and SAWScript

## For SAW developers

Presently, the `saw-script` main executable cannot be loaded into GHCi due to a
linker issue. However, the rest of the library can be manipulated in GHCi, with
a little convincing.

If you are using `cabal` to build, select the `saw-script` target:

```
$ cabal new-repl saw-script
```

In order to use interactive tools like `intero`, you need to configure them with
this target. You can configure `intero-mode` in Emacs to use the `saw-script`
library target by setting the variable `intero-targets` to the string
`"saw-script:lib"`. To make this setting persistent for all files in this
project, place the following snippet in the file `src/.dir-locals.el`:

```elisp
((haskell-mode
  (intero-targets "saw-script:lib")))
```

## Notes on Freeze Files

We use the `cabal.GHC-*.config` files to constrain dependency versions
in CI, and recommend using the following command for best results before
building locally:

```
ln -s cabal.GHC-<VER>.config cabal.project.freeze
```

These configuration files were generated using `cabal freeze`, but with
some manual changes to allow cross-platfom builds, since Unix-like
systems and Windows systems end up with different package dependencies.
Specifically, we remove lines for the following packages or flags:

```
abcBridge
cryptol-saw-core
regex-posix
saw-remote-api
saw-script
tasty +unix
unix
unix-compat
unix-time
```
