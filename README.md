# SAWScript

This repository contains the code for SAWScript, the scripting
language that forms the primary user interface to the Software
Analysis Workbench (SAW). It provides the ability to reason about
formal models describing the denotation of programs written in
languages such as C, Java, and Cryptol. It also provides experimental,
incomplete support for the Rust language.

## Documentation

There are two SAWScript tutorials that give an introduction to using the
SAWScript interpreter:

* [This tutorial](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/blob/master/doc/pdfs/llvm-java-verification-with-saw.pdf) gives an
  introduction to verifying C code (using LLVM) and Java code (using JVM).
* [This tutorial](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/blob/master/doc/pdfs/rust-verification-with-saw.pdf)
  gives an introduction to verifying Rust code (using MIR).

There is also a longer
[manual](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/blob/master/doc/pdfs/saw-user-manual.pdf)
that describes the breadth of SAWScript's features.

## Precompiled Binaries

Precompiled SAWScript binaries for a variety of platforms are available
on the [releases
page](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/releases).

## Docker Images

Alternatively, there is a Docker image available from the [packages
page](https://github.com/orgs/GaloisInc/packages/container/package/saw).

## Getting Z3

SAW can use many theorem provers, but because of its use of Cryptol it
always needs to have Microsoft Research's [Z3 SMT
solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) installed.  You can download Z3
binaries for a variety of platforms from their [releases
page](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases).

We currently recommend Z3 4.8.10. If you plan to use path satisfiability
checking, you'll also need Yices version 2.6.1 or newer.

After installation, make sure that `z3` (or `z3.exe` on Windows)
is on your PATH.

## Cloning the Repository

After cloning the saw-script repository, you need to also clone
submodules.
Run `git submodule update --init`.
The commonly used `--recursive` option is not required, and also not
recommended as it results in cloning a considerable number of
additional unused subtrees.

## Manual Installation

To build SAWScript and related utilities from source:

  * Ensure that you have the `cabal` and `ghc` executables in your
    `PATH`. If you don't already have them, we recommend using `ghcup`
    to install them: <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/>. We recommend
    Cabal 3.10 or newer, and GHC 9.4, 9.6, or 9.8.

  * Ensure that you have the C libraries and header files for
    `terminfo`, which generally comes as part of `ncurses` on most
    platforms. On Fedora, it is part of the `ncurses-compat-libs` package.
    You will also need the C headers for `zlib`.

  * Ensure that you have the programs `javac` and `z3` on your
    `PATH`. Z3 binaries are available at
    https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases

    On MacOS you need an actual JDK; the placeholder `javac` that
    comes with the system by default, unfortunately, breaks SAW.
    See issue [#1709](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/issues/1709).

  * Optionally, put in place dependency version freeze files:

        ln -s cabal.<ghc version>.config cabal.project.freeze

  * Run `cabal update` if you had installed `cabal` prior to using this README.

  * Build SAWScript by running

        ./build.sh

    The SAWScript executables will be available in the `bin` directory.

  * Optionally, run ./stage.sh to create a binary tarball.

## Notes on LLVM

SAW can analyze LLVM programs (usually derived from C, but potentially
for other languages). The only tool strictly required for this is a
compiler that can generate LLVM bitcode, such as `clang`. However,
having the full LLVM tool suite available can be useful. We have tested
SAW with LLVM and `clang` versions from 3.5 to 16.0, as well as the
version of `clang` bundled with Apple Xcode. We welcome bug reports on
any failure to parse bitcode from LLVM versions in that range.

Note that successful parsing doesn't necessarily mean that verification
will be possible for all language constructs. There are various
instructions that are not supported during verification. However,
any failure during `llvm_load_module` should be considered a bug.

## Notes on Rust

SAW has experimental support for analyzing Rust programs. To do so, one must
compile Rust code using [`mir-json`](https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-json), a
tool which compiles Rust code to a machine-readable, JSON-based format.

Currently, SAW supports [version
1](https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-json/blob/master/SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md#1) of
`mir-json`'s schema. Note that the schema versions produced by `mir-json` can
change over time as dictated by internal requirements and upstream changes. To
help smooth this over:

* We intend that once SAW introduces support for any given schema version, it
  will retain that support across at least two releases.
* An exception to this rule is when `mir-json` updates to support a new Rust
  toolchain version. In general, we cannot promise backwards compatibility
  across Rust toolchains, as the changes are often significant enough to
  impeded any ability to reasonably provide backwards-compatibility guarantees.

Moreover, SAW requires slightly modified versions of the Rust standard
libraries that are suited to verification purposes. SAW consults the value of
the `SAW_RUST_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to determine where to look for
these modified standard libraries.

For complete instructions on how to install `mir-json`, the modified Rust
standard libraries, and how to defined the `SAW_RUST_LIBRARY_PATH` environment
variable, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-json#installation-instructions).

## Notes on Windows

If you have trouble loading the SAW REPL on Windows, try invoking it
with the `--no-color` option.

## Related Packages

Many dependencies are automatically downloaded into `deps/` when you
build using `build.sh`; see
[Manual Installation](#manual-installation) above. Key automatically
downloaded dependencies include:

* `deps/crucible/`:         [Crucible symbolic execution engine](https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible)
* `deps/cryptol/`:          [Cryptol](https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol)

## For SAW developers

Presently, the `saw-script` main executable cannot be loaded into GHCi due to a
linker issue. However, the rest of the library can be manipulated in GHCi, with
a little convincing.

If you are using `cabal` to build, select the `saw-script` target:

```
$ cabal new-repl saw-script
```

In order to use interactive tools like `intero`, you need to configure them with
this target. You can configure `intero-mode` in Emacs to use the `saw-script`
library target by setting the variable `intero-targets` to the string
`"saw-script:lib"`. To make this setting persistent for all files in this
project, place the following snippet in the file `src/.dir-locals.el`:

```elisp
((haskell-mode
  (intero-targets "saw-script:lib")))
```

## Notes on Freeze Files

We use the `cabal.GHC-*.config` files to constrain dependency versions
in CI, and recommend using the following command for best results before
building locally:

```
ln -s cabal.GHC-<VER>.config cabal.project.freeze
```

These configuration files were generated using `cabal freeze`, but with
some manual changes to allow cross-platfom builds, since Unix-like
systems and Windows systems end up with different package dependencies.
Specifically, we remove lines for the following packages or flags:

```
cryptol-saw-core
regex-posix
saw-remote-api
saw-script
tasty +unix
unix
unix-compat
unix-time
```
