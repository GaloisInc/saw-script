<span class="lineno">   27 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   28 </span>-- The exposed panic interface in SAW takes two arguments:

<span class="lineno">   50 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   51 </span>-- The arguments to each panic should be written so they make sense in
<span class="lineno">   52 </span>-- this context.
<span class="lineno">   53 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   54 </span>-- Also note that because the description lines are indented after
<span class="lineno">   55 </span>-- being unlines'd, they should not contain their own newlines.
<span class="lineno">   56 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   57 </span>-- It is reasonable to use the function name as the &quot;location of the
<span class="lineno">   58 </span>-- problem&quot;; however, it's often more helpful to use a short string
<span class="lineno">   59 </span>-- that describes what SAW was trying to do when things came unstuck.
<span class="lineno">   60 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   61 </span>-- Then, the rest of the message should indicate what happened and
<span class="lineno">   62 </span>-- also include the values of relevant variables. What gets printed
<span class="lineno">   63 </span>-- here may be all you ever get to try to figure out what broke.
<span class="lineno">   64 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   65 </span>-- It's important that the combination of the &quot;location&quot; string and
<span class="lineno">   66 </span>-- the beginning of the rest of the message should be unique.
<span class="lineno">   67 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   68 </span>-- Rationale:
<span class="lineno">   69 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   70 </span>-- In an ideal world no user would ever see a panic. However, the
<span class="lineno">   71 </span>-- reality of software is that sooner or later someone will see every
<span class="lineno">   72 </span>-- panic in the system. Furthermore, chances are that person will
<span class="lineno">   73 </span>-- probably be a downstream user, in the field. This will be someone
<span class="lineno">   74 </span>-- who has little or no familiarity with SAW's internals -- given the
<span class="lineno">   75 </span>-- nature of SAW they will probably not be a completely clueless end
<span class="lineno">   76 </span>-- user, but even so internal minutiae won't be helpful.
<span class="lineno">   77 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   78 </span>-- Therefore, that user (not the SAW developer) is the primary
<span class="lineno">   79 </span>-- audience for every panic message. Panic messages should tell the
<span class="lineno">   80 </span>-- user enough about what happened that they can try to rearrange
<span class="lineno">   81 </span>-- their stuff to avoid triggering it. They should also tell the user
<span class="lineno">   82 </span>-- enough that they have a reasonable chance at being able to cut down
<span class="lineno">   83 </span>-- whatever they're working on to something they can send upstream
<span class="lineno">   84 </span>-- with a bug report.
<span class="lineno">   85 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   86 </span>-- The SAW developer is the _secondary_ audience for every panic
<span class="lineno">   87 </span>-- message, but in general only via the bug reports that come from the
<span class="lineno">   88 </span>-- primary audience.
<span class="lineno">   89 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   90 </span>-- In most cases the function name where something blew up will not
<span class="lineno">   91 </span>-- mean much to the user seeing the panic. Hence the recommendation
<span class="lineno">   92 </span>-- for a short descriptive string instead.
<span class="lineno">   93 </span>--
<span class="lineno">   94 </span>-- The function name is also readily found via the module name, line
<span class="lineno">   95 </span>-- number, and message text. (The reason the message text needs to be
<span class="lineno">   96 </span>-- unique is that if it's not, it's easy to end up looking at the
<span class="lineno">   97 </span>-- wrong instance, despite line numbers, and then things become far
<span class="lineno">   98 </span>-- more confusing.) It's therefore not particularly important to
<span class="lineno">   99 </span>-- include it in the message if there's a better alternative.
<span class="lineno">  100 </span>--
<span class="lineno">  101 </span>-- Because panics in general get reported, not found directly by
<span class="lineno">  102 </span>-- developers, and are often hard to reproduce locally or on demand,
<span class="lineno">  103 </span>-- it's routinely necessary to diagnose and fix problems entirely or
<span class="lineno">  104 </span>-- almost entirely by analysis of the panic message and the code
<span class="lineno">  105 </span>-- around it. For this reason panics should include as much relevant
<span class="lineno">  106 </span>-- information as possible without flooding the recipient.
