# Overview

This repository contains a backend for the `saw-core` library that outputs terms
in the syntax of Coq. The Coq files generated by this backend depend on the Coq
support libraries described below, which must be compiled in Coq in order to be
used.


# The Coq Support Libraries

The Coq files that are generated by the `saw-core-coq` backend rely on a number
of support libraries, some of which are generated from the SAW core prelude
files and some of which are hand-written extensions of those libraries. These
support libraries must be compiled by Coq in order to use them.


## Installing Dependencies

To compile the Coq support libraries, Coq must be installed, as must the
following library:

* [coq-bits](https://github.com/coq-community/bits)

The recommended way to install Coq and these dependencies is using `opam`. This
can be done with the following steps, which will not only install `opam`, Coq, and
the above mentioned Coq libraries, but will make sure to install the proper
version of Coq needed for those libraries.

To install `opam` and Coq:
```
sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
opam init
opam pin add rocq-prover 9.0.0
opam install rocq-core=9.1.0 rocq-stdlib=9.0.0
opam repo add rocq-released https://rocq-prover.org/opam/released
```

Installing the required version of `coq-bits` (linked above) also requires
installing the `coq` package, which includes compatibility shims to support the
Coq to Rocq transition (e.g. the `coqc` and `coq_makefile` executables):
```
opam install coq=9.1.0
opam pin coq-bits https://github.com/rocq-community/bits.git#f50fc3e5f1eabcb0b0b94c8d25f75e61a255c2ba
```

If you run into any issue that is probably due to the version mismatch between the `ocamlc`
and the `ocaml` base system installed on your machine and it can be fixed as explained
[here](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/3708).

Currently, the Coq support libraries for `saw-core-coq` require `rocq-core`
version `9.1.0` and `rocq-stdlib` version `9.0.0`.

## Building the and Using the Coq Support Libraries

The `coq/` directory contains the Coq support libraries for the `saw-core-coq`
backend, as well as a number of example Coq files that have been generated from
existing SAW proofs. In order to build just the Coq support libraries, the
following commands can be used:

```
cd coq
make generated/CryptolToCoq/SAWCorePrelude.vo
```

To use these libraries, the following lines can be added to a `_CoqProject`
file, where PATH_TO_SAW is replaced by the path to the `saw-script` directory:

```
-Q PATH_TO_SAW/saw-core-coq/coq/generated/CryptolToCoq   CryptolToCoq
-Q PATH_TO_SAW/saw-core-coq/coq/handwritten/CryptolToCoq   CryptolToCoq
```


## Generating the Coq Support Libraries

The Coq support libraries can be re-generated from their SAWCore/Cryptol
counterparts if these modules change.  This can be done in the `saw/` directory,
by running the scripts there with an appropriate version of the `saw`
executable.  The output of such files are currently being version-controlled, as
a way of keeping track of their evolution.

```
/path/to/saw generate_scaffolding.saw
```


# Directory Structure

* `coq/` contains handwritten Coq files in `handwritten/` and generated ones in
  `generated/`, as well as some files needed to build the Coq files.

* `cryptol/` contains some Cryptol files that we care about extracting.

* `saw/` contains SAW scripts that generate the Coq files.


## Coq Files Organization

The Coq files have a somewhat complex organization.  We demonstrate the current
dependencies, ignoring transitive dependencies for clarity:

```
                      SAWCoreScaffolding (H)
                          /           \
SAWCoreVectorsAsCoqVectors (H)   SAWCoreVectorsAsCoqLists (H)
                          \           /
  CoqVectorsExtra (H)    SAWCorePrelude (G)
             \            /            \
   CryptolPrimitivesForSAWCore (G)     SAWCorePreludeExtra (H)
                         \               /
               CryptolPrimitivesForSAWCoreExtra (H)

```

(G) stands for generated files, while (H) stands for handwritten files.

* `SAWCoreScaffolding` defines some of SAW core primitive types and values.

* `SAWCoreVectorsAsCoqVectors` and `SAWCoreVectorsAsCoqLists` are two
  realizations of the vector type, the latter ignoring the type index. In
  practice, we have found that the latter is a no-go for proofs unless
  values are packaged with a proof that their length is equal to the index.

* `SAWCorePrelude` is generated from `Prelude.sawcore`, available in the
  `saw-core` project.

* `CoqVectorsExtra` contains facts about vectors that the Coq standard library
  does not provide.

* `CryptolPrimitivesForSAWCore` is generated from `Cryptol.sawcore`, available
  in the `cryptol-saw-core` project.

* `SAWCorePreludeExtra` defines useful functions for
  `CryptolPrimitivesForSAWCoreExtra` to use.

* `CryptolPrimitivesForSAWCoreExtra` contains some additional useful
  definitions.
