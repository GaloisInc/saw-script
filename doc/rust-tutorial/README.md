To update the tutorial, edit `rust-tutorial.md` and then run `make`. The output
is generated in `./tmp`. If you want to version a new copy of the tutorial,
copy `./tmp/sawScriptRustTutorial.pdf` to `./sawScriptRustTutorial.pdf` and
commit.

Note that some uses of the `^` character in this tutorial cause problems with
especially old versions of `pandoc`. I have confirmed that the tutorial builds
successfully with `pandoc 2.17.1.1` or later.
