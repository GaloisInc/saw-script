# SAW User Manual

:::{warning}
The SAW User Manual is currently being restructured/rewritten in large chunks.

It is likely that you will encounter typos, omissions, and otherwise incorrect
or incomplete information about SAW and SAWScript's features and operation.

Your help identifying these [documentation
issues](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation)
is deeply appreciated, as it helps us prioritize and resolve them more quickly.
Thanks for helping to make SAW better for everyone!
