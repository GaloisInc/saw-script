\begin{abstract}

We introduce the SAWScript language, aiming to provide a programmable
interface to Galois's formal verification technologies, covering the
Cryptol, Java, and LLVM languages. We use various simple programs as
examples, taken from the domain of cryptography. Our proofs use
SAWScript to equivalence check functions written in one language
against their counterparts in another, or reference implementations in
one language against more efficient production implementations in the
same language.
