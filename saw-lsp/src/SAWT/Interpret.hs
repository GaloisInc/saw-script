-- Interpretation of statement blocks

-- | Always executed in an empty environment.
--
-- Before executing a script, this function tries to find the largest prefix of
-- the script that's already been executed, and if it finds one, it will restore
-- the associated checkpoint and continue from there. If it doesn't find one, it
-- will revert to executing all statements individually.
--
-- Caching behavior can be "aggressive", in which case checkpoints are created
-- after every statement is (newly) executed, or not, in which case a checkpoint
-- is only created after the last statement in the script is executed.
