This repository contains the code for the Cryptol Symbolic Simulator
(CSS). It is currently used primarily as a library from SAWScript, but
also produces a stand-alone executable, `css`. This executable has
only limited functionality: it can translate a single Cryptol function
to an And-Inverter Graph (AIG).
