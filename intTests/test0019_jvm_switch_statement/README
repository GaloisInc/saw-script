Test that JSS can handle switch statements.

JSS couldn't handle switch statements with more than one case:
https://github.com/GaloisInc/jvm-verifier/issues/2.

There are two JVM instructions for switch, 'lookupswitch' and
'tableswitch' --
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-3.html#jvms-3.10
-- so we include tests that generate both instructions.
