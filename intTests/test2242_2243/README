Examples from #2242 (scoping regression in proof_subshell) and #2243
(bindings escape proof_subshell).

It might be better to use test-and-diff.sh here so as to capture the
output; however, it doesn't work. For a TopLevel subshell, the input
for the subshell needs to be on stdin, even if you use .isaw files
with saw -B, and test-and-diff.sh can't do that. For a ProofScript
subshell, it's even worse: for some reason one gets "Proof subshells
not supported".
