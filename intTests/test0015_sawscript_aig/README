Test AIG generation in SAWScript.

These examples provide some documentation of the SAWScript AIG
encoding.

Note that, compared to LSS and JSS, the arguments here are reversed:
for functions '\x -> \y -> e' the arguments are packed as 'x # y'
here, but as 'y # x' for LSS and JSS. However, in LSS and JSS you
don't actually write the arguments explicitly -- rather, open terms
are closed over the symbolic variables in scope -- so I'm not sure the
comparison is fair.
