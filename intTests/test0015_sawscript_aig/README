Test AIG generation in SAWScript.

These examples provide some documentation of the SAWScript AIG
encoding.

Note that, compared to JSS, the arguments here are reversed: for
functions '\x -> \y -> e' the arguments are packed as 'x # y' here, but
as 'y # x' for JSS. However, in JSS you don't actually write the
arguments explicitly -- rather, open terms are closed over the symbolic
variables in scope -- so I'm not sure the comparison is fair.
