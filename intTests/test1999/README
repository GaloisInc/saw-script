# SAW Tests for `mir_ref_of` and `mir_ref_of_mut`

This directory contains tests that demonstrate the use of `mir_ref_of` and
`mir_ref_of_mut` in both preconditions and postconditions of SAW
specifications. These are intended to verify correctness and usability compared
to the more verbose `mir_alloc` + `mir_points_to` pattern.

These tests correspond to:

## Tests using `mir_ref_of`

- `pre-test.rs` / `pre-test.saw`  
  SAW uses `mir_ref_of` in the precondition.

- `post-test.rs` / `post-test.saw`  
  SAW uses `mir_ref_of` in the postcondition.

- `pre-test-override.saw`  
  Uses `mir_unsafe_assume_spec` with `mir_ref_of` in the precondition as an
  override to verify a downstream function.

- `post-test-override.saw`  
  Uses `mir_unsafe_assume_spec` with `mir_ref_of` in the postcondition as an
  override to verify a downstream function.

## Tests using `mir_ref_of_mut`

- `pre-test-mut.saw`  
  SAW uses `mir_ref_of_mut` in the precondition.

- `post-test-mut.saw`  
  SAW uses `mir_ref_of_mut` in the postcondition to describe the result.

- `pre-test-mut-override.saw`  
  Uses `mir_unsafe_assume_spec` with `mir_ref_of_mut` in the precondition as an
  override to verify a downstream function.

- `post-test-mut-override.saw`  
  Uses `mir_unsafe_assume_spec` with `mir_ref_of_mut` in the postcondition as
  an override to verify a downstream function.
