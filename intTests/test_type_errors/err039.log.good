 err039.saw:7:10-7:25: Type mismatch.
    Term is not a function. (Maybe a function is applied to too many arguments?)
    err039.saw:7:10-7:25: The type t.0 -> t.1 arises from the context of the term
    <type of concat>:1:19-1:22: The type [Int] arises from this type annotation

    Expected: t.0 -> t.1
    Found:    [Int]

    within "xs" (err039.saw:7:5-7:7)
