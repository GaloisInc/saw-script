Tests for the dynamic scope bug, as described in #1646.

(These tests were added in #2403, in response to #2401.)

We don't endorse the behavior captured here, and the expectation is
that eventually we'll implement some kind of alternative means of
doing the same thing and remove the current behavior. In the meantime,
these tests prevent accidentally fixing it.

The basic behavior is that rebinding a variable causes past references
to it (in functions) to see the new value, even though in principle
they should have closed over the old value. This only applies to
bindings at the syntactic top level. Bindings within functions, or
even top-level bindings within a do-block, behave normally.
