Test AIG generation in LSS using SAW backend.

The tests in 'test.saw' only make sense for the SAW backend; the
default backend encodes the arguments and results in a different
way.

There used to be a bug in JSS and LSS where multiple AIG writes
interacted, causing the number of input bits in the AIG to grow with
each write. So in 'test.sh' we are careful to check that the number of
input bits is always 16.

Unlike JSS, the AIGs generated here are very unsurprising. See
../test0012_jss_aig/README for a discussion of the JSS weirdness.
