# Tests that are not run when running the `coverage` CI job, which builds SAW
# with HPC code coverage enabled. Unfortunately, Haskell executables compiled
# with coverage enabled have a tendency to use greater amounts of memory, and
# when running these test cases, the difference in memory is enough to exceed
# the maximum memory requirements imposed by GitHub Actions CI runners.
