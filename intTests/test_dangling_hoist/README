This test is related to https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/issues/1316
Previously, the hoist_ifs_in_goal and goal_eval tactics would not properly
take care of the dependencies arising from Pi binders and this would
result in dangling variables. This test exercises those tactics
with dependent binders to check that this does not occur.
