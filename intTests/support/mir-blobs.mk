# Make fragment for building mir-json binary blobs
# Usage:
#    - set MIR_SRCS to the basenames of all Rust sources
#      (e.g. if you have foo.rs and bar.rs, set MIR_SRCS=foo bar)
#    - set SUPPORTDIR if needed (see below)
#    - include this file
#    - make sure some version of "all:" is still the first target (it
#      is first here, but if you include multiple fragments or need
#      other stuff first, put "all:;" at the top of your makefile)
#
# To use this file from outside the intTests tree, set SUPPORTDIR
# explicitly to point at intTests/support. (Notably, this file is
# also used for the saw-python test artefacts.)
