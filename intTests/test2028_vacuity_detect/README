This test checks for vacuous proofs across LLVM, MIR, and JVM backends.

It corresponds to issue https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/issues/2028

Each function includes a contradictory precondition (e.g., x != x), and SAW should detect this
and emit a vacuity warning before successfully proving the function.
