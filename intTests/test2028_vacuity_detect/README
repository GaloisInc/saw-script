This test checks for vacuous proofs in the MIR, and JVM backends. It skips
LLVM as that is already tested in test0064.

It corresponds to issue https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/issues/2028

Each function includes a contradictory precondition (e.g., x != x), and SAW
should detect this and emit a vacuity warning before successfully proving the
function.
