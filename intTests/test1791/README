A relative path in a SAWScript file should be relative to the
directory the file lives in, not the directory SAW was in when it was
loaded. This is, though not necessarily automatically correct (there
is a lot to be said for always creating all _output_ in the current
directory) the current behavior and we don't want it to regress
without being noticed.

In here we test the following things:

paths01:
   - An include statement with a relative path should get the right
     file.
   - Within the included file, another include statement with a
     relative path should get the right file.
   - Then do a second include statement with a relative path in the
     original file, to make sure the interpretation doesn't change.

paths02:
   - Cryptol imports (in the absence of other considerations, like
     CRYPTOLPATH) should be relative to the script file as well.

paths03:
   - load_sawcore_from_file gets the right file.

paths04:
   - The file written as a result of the -s (summarize) option should
     appear in the startup directory, not the script directory.

paths05:
   - write_smtlib2 outputs to the script directory.

paths06:
   - write_coq_term outputs to the script directory.

paths07:
   - offline_w4_unint_z3 outputs to the script directory.

Note that we don't test either every file reader or every file writer,
although perhaps we should eventually (note: there are a lot); instead
we take a representative sample from different parts of the system.
