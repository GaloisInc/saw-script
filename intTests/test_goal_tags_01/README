This is a simple test of the "goal tagging" instructions.

The test is setup to produce two tagged goals, and the tags are used
by the proof tactic uses to select a proving method.  Any additional
goals are ignored, and should lead to a proof failure. This test
ensures the goals are being correctly tagged and filtered.
