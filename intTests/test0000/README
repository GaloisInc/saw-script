We attempt to prove the equivalance of a stream-equation and a directly-recursive
definition of the Fibonocci numbers.

Observed behavior: saw executable blows out its stack and crashes to command prompt.

Desired behavior:
  1) a valid proof
  2) failing that, a graceful failure of the symbolic simulator.
