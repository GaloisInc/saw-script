Here we have tests for the language-level SAWScript builtins,
as well as a few aspects of the language itself.

Exactly what that does and doesn't include isn't super well defined,
because as of this writing the boundary between the language and the
underlying SAW system isn't well defined either, but in general it
means stuff that wouldn't leave the interpreter if that boundary
_were_ well defined.

So for example:
   - monad ops
   - list ops
   - things that work around missing language features like caseSatResult
   - show
   - eval_*
   - undefined, fail
   - include, read_bytes
   - interpreter internal bits like dump_file_AST

For the time being it does not include the operations for manipulating
SAWCore or Cryptol terms and types.

Note that while "fails" and "return" are not explicitly tested,
they're used in various places that will notice if they don't work
and that seems sufficient.
