This is a test of the `llvm_refine_spec` command.  We write separate
specifications for a function at a specific range of concrete values,
and then combine the spec into a single one using refinement.

The tested function computes the base 2 logarithm for a small
collection of values directly via "switch" statement. We prove
the correctness of the algorithm individually for each of the
handled values, then assemble them into a single spec that
characterizes the allowed inputs via nontrivial preconditions.

This test ensures both that the expected refinement proof succeeds,
and that an over-general specification (which includes too many
values) fails.
