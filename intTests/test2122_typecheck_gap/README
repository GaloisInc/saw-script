This test checks for consistent type checking of predicate terms across the
LLVM, MIR, and JVM backends. It corresponds to issue
https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/issues/2122.

Each function includes an assertion over a term that is not of Cryptol type `Bit`.
SAW should reject the spec during verification and emit an error message containing:

  Expected type: Bit
  Actual type:   () -> Bit

This message should appear once per backend: LLVM, MIR, and JVM.
