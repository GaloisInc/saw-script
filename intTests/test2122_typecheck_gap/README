These tests check for consistent type checking of predicate terms across the
LLVM, MIR, and JVM backends. They corresponds to issue:

https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/issues/2122.

Each test function includes an assertion over a term that is not of Cryptol type `Bit`.
SAW should reject the spec during verification with an error message containing:

  Expected type: Bit
  Actual type:   () -> Bit

This is tested using the standard type error harness in `test_type_errors/`.
Specifically:
  - `err054.saw` tests the LLVM backend
  - `err055.saw` tests the JVM backend
  - `err056.saw` tests the MIR backend
