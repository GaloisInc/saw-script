-- Support

-- This is used to reject top-level execution of polymorphic
-- expressions. Assumes we aren't inside an uninstantiated forall
-- quantifier. Also assumes the typechecker has already approved the
-- type. This means we know it doesn't contain unbound named type
-- variables. Fail if we encounter a unification var.
--
-- XXX: this serves little purpose. A polymorphic expression must
-- either be a partially applied (or unapplied) polymorphic function,
-- in which case we aren't going to actually execute anything anyway,
-- or be fully applied but have a polymorphic return type, and the
-- only such functions we can have are those that don't return (like
-- "fail") so we don't actually care what they produce. So this code
-- and the check that calls it should probably be removed.
--
-- XXX: also, this is here transiently so that the rejection continues
-- to work while the interaction between the interpreter and the
-- typechecker is rationalized. In the long run, the rejection should
-- really belong only to the repl for repl purposes and the
-- polymorphism check should be part of the currently nonexistent
-- incremental interface to the typechecker. Alternatively, if there
-- are cases that really require rejection of polymorphic expressions
-- at the top level, they also require rejection of polymorphic
-- expressions in nested do-blocks that aren't inside functions, and
-- it can and should all happen inside the typechecker.

-- Environment updates

-- The second argument (the schema, aka type) is Nothing in most
-- cases, but for Decls is taken from the Decl. This will always be
-- Just s for Decls that have been typechecked, which are the only
-- ones we should be handling here.
--
-- Meanwhile the Maybe Type field of PVar is also always Just ty for
-- patterns that have been typechecked, and the typechecker will have
-- established that the type of the pattern matches the type of the
-- Decl if there is one.
--
-- So we should be able to remove the schema argument (and with it the
-- mess for dividing up a passed-in tuple), but for the moment I'm
-- unwilling to in case there's something weird going on somewhere.
-- For the time being we'll just panic if the pattern type is missing
-- and use it to fill in the schema if there isn't a schema passed
-- down. We could also assert that the schema type and the pattern
-- type actually match, but it's intentionally difficult to do that
-- outside the typechecker and not really worthwhile.
--
-- XXX: at some point clean this up further.

-- IsValue and FromValue

-- | Class for injecting Haskell values into SAWScript values. This
--   is straightforward for scalars. For functions, it gets a bit
--   wibbly.
--
--   First, some history. Until July 2025 there was a relatively
--   straightforward IsValue instance for (a -> b) that matched any
--   argument type a that supported FromValue, and any result type
--   supporting IsValue, including functions. Thus, because Haskell
--   functions are curried, functions of more than one argument would
--   generate a Value that took one argument and produced a result
--   recursively using the IsValue instance for the rest of the
--   function. This produced a chain of Values, each being a closure
--   of type Value -> TopLevel Value, and the interpreter could call
--   them by applying argument Values one at a time.
--
--   This is fine as long as you're ok with blindly applying arguments
--   until you get something else back, which is fine as long as all
--   the interpreter does is execute. However, there are some other
--   things we'd like to have: correct stack traces require knowing
--   the name of the function being called at the application of the
--   last argument. Nice stack traces also involve having the
--   arguments to the function at that point. Furthermore, if all you
--   have in the Value is a closure, and someone wants to print it for
--   debugging, all you can print is "<<closure>>" or "<<function>>"
--   or similar. It would be much nicer to at least be able to print
--   the name of the builtin hiding in the closure.
--
--   For all of these things, one wants additional info in the Value
--   besides just the closure, and critically, that info needs to be
--   carried over when an argument is applied. It is really ugly to do
--   that if you just have a closure that returns an arbitrary Value;
--   you have to apply the argument, unwrap the result and then try to
--   guess if you just applied the last argument and got a return
--   value (which might also be a lambda from somewhere else) or you
--   didn't and you should cary the metadata over. That really won't
--   do.
--
--   Therefore, in July 2025, we added another type BuiltinWrapper to
--   hold the closure chain. There are two cases of BuiltinWrapper,
--   one where you apply the last arg and get a Value back, and one
--   where you apply something less than the last arg and get a new
--   BuiltinWrapper back. Therefore, when applying an argument to a
--   value holding a builtin function, you can branch on the cases,
--   and if what you have is still a partly applied builtin, you can
--   carry over the metadata and update it accordingly. Furthermore,
--   for the purposes of managing the stack trace, you can know when
--   you're applying the last argument, because that's the time when
--   you need to add a frame to the trace.
--
--   In this environment, IsValue for a function must generate a chain
--   of BuiltinWrappers rather than a chain of Values. This turns out
--   to be problematic. A tidy way to do it would be to have a
--   separate IsFuncValue class that recursively collects that chain,
--   then have a single flat IsValue instance for functions that
--   splices it in. Or, alternatively, make IsFuncValue and
--   IsBaseValue classes, and then an umbrella IsValue class that
--   pulls them both in. None of this works. You can't have instances
--   of the form "instance IsBaseValue a => IsValue a"; Haskell treats
--   this as one instance for all types a, rather than as a derivation
--   rule to generate an instance for any type a that matches the
--   constraints.
--
--   Instead, we keep a single `IsValue` class and instead add more
--   members to it.
--
--   The `toValue` member produces a Value; this is the external entry
--   point, so it gets called on scalars and all full complete
--   function types in the builtins table.
--
--   The `isFunction` member returns a boolean indicating whether the
--   value type we're handling is a function. This function requires a
--   value of the appropriate type in order to allow the typeclass to
--   match, but doesn't use it. The class provides a default
--   implementation of False, which is overridden explicitly only in
--   the instance for functions.
--
--   The `toWrapper` member produces a `BuiltinWrapper`. The instance
--   for functions uses this to recurse and produce the chain of
--   `BuiltinWrapper` values containing closures. It uses
--   `isBaseValue` on the function return type to check whether it's
--   on the last argument or not, and constructs the wrapper
--   accordingly. A default implementation that panics is provided;
--   only the function instance overrides that.
--
--   Be careful: there's a possible hole in this logic, which is that
--   we treat Value itself as a non-function value. There needs to be
--   an IsValue instance for Value, because there are a number of
--   builtins whose Haskell type involves Value, generally in order to
--   be polymorphic at the SAWScript level. Any builtin that _returns_
--   Value (arguments use FromValue and are safe from these concerns),
--   and want that Value to wrap a Haskell function, need to cons up
--   the proper BuiltinWrapper chain by hand. A few examples exist.
--
--   (Also note that it must work this way; we _cannot_ examine the
--   argument to `isFunction` because the `toWrapper` logic for
--   functions must decide which case it's looking at without calling
--   its function to get a value of the proper type and there isn't
--   any other concrete one to use.)
--
--   There is no FromValue instance for functions. If we want to have
--   builtins taking callback arguments, we'll need to do something
--   about that, and it'll probably get complicated. (Currently
--   everything that looks like a callback is a monadic action taking
--   no arguments.)
--
--   Note if working on this code that any change to the logic that
--   involves additional annotations or explicitly distinguishing
--   functions from scalars will require touching ~every entry in the
--   builtins table, and there are a _lot_ of builtins.
--
--   Also be aware that there are a handful of builtins that _execute_
--   in TopLevel when applied, rather than returning a SAWScript
--   TopLevel action.  As things stand these _must_ circumvent this
--   logic and not use toValue directly; there is no way to get the
--   function values generated herein to behave that way, because
--   there's no difference in the types to work from.

-- The "for" builtin.
--
-- XXX: this is the only thing in the tree that uses VBindOnce.
-- Unfortunately, for the time being it needs to be this way:
--    - as a builtin it can only operate in Value;
--    - VDo contains abstract syntax;
--    - there is no way to lift an arbitrary Value into the abstract
--      syntax, and there won't be anytime soon, because there's
--      already enough of a tangle with Value and the interpreter
--      state without also including the entire abstract syntax in
--      the yarn ball;
--    - it needs to be able to do SAWScript-level binds and those
--      are the only ways.
--
-- Probably the best long-term solution is to move the implementation
-- into the SAWScript prelude, once we have one (see #253; that
-- issue's been open a long time), since the only thing stopping that
-- is having a place to put the code.
--
-- Failing that, at some point the SAWScript interpreter will
-- hopefully have been cleaned up to the point where there's a Value
-- case in the abstract syntax, which there properly speaking should
-- be anyway, at which point this can be rewritten with VDo.
--
-- Failing _that_, it's probably possible to open-code the bind here
-- in terms of calling pieces of the interpreter directly, but that's
-- likely to be quite messy.
